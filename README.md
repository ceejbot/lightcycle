# LightCycle

This is a translation into Rust of a toy consistent hash ring I wrote in Javascript a long time ago. I'm not sure it's useful for any production workloads, but the concept is generally handy for distributing items to to specific instances of otherwise-identical resources in a balanced way. An example might be sticky sessions, or items you want to cache.

Not yet finished. Why are you stalking my github. Yes, it's probably broken. I haven't written tests yet.

## Example

```rust
```

## API

`cargo doc --open` might help.
